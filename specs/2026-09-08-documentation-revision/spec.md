# Documentation revision

Status: active.

Implementation is ready for review. Redundant deployment notes, historical API
notes, unaccepted product ideas, and defensive lists of unused patterns were
removed. The staging configuration was reconciled with the repository. Frozen
specifications were not changed.

## Outcome

Current WMS documentation is compact, non-contradictory, and divided by
purpose: product and business truth, engineering conventions, unfinished work,
and the staging runbook. Historical specifications remain decision history
rather than another current manual.

## Scope

- Critically revise `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and
  `STAGING.md` against current code and deployment configuration.
- Remove duplication, completed work, speculative backlog, generic advice, and
  implementation detail that belongs in code or another current document.
- Reduce the specification registry to active work and lifecycle rules; keep
  frozen specification files unchanged.
- Remove auxiliary deployment notes and examples that duplicate or contradict
  `STAGING.md`, and correct user-facing deployment guidance where necessary.

## Out of scope

- Rewriting or deleting frozen specifications.
- Changing product behavior, architecture, deployment topology, or secrets.
- Changing the documentation workflow or adding automated checks.
- Documenting hypothetical workflows or future mechanisms without an accepted
  requirement.

## Acceptance criteria

- Each lasting fact has one obvious current owner and is not repeated merely
  for emphasis.
- Current documentation agrees with source code, migrations, Mobile settings,
  Docker Compose, and Caddy configuration.
- The roadmap contains unfinished accepted work only.
- The staging runbook contains one first-time path, one routine-update path,
  and focused recovery notes without duplicate command lists.
- Local Markdown links resolve and `git diff --check` passes.
- No runtime code or automated tests are changed.
